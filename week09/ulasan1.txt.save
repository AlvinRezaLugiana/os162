 At this moment, me myself Alvin Reza and my friend Risyad Ridho will review about one interesting video from Youtube called “Introduction to Hacking” from Youtuber named “Eli the  Computer Guy”. In this video which have a duration 69 minutes 40 seconds, we will learn about what actually the meaning of hacking, who are hackers, why hacker hacks, how hackers plan hack, how the hackers protect themselves, and how you protect yourself from hackers.

Hacking is simply a technical skill set. It is a non conventional ways of interacting with the systems and getting to data. The meaning of conventional ways is the way the designer’s of the system wants the user to interact and the non conventional ways is exploring the system not in the way that the designers want to. Then who is hacker? Of course hackers are people who do hacking.
There are three types of hackers,

    Black hat hackers : Evil hacker that destroys systems and steals data. We can think it as the bad guy.
    White hat hackers : It’s like an angel hacker, hacking to discover, always do hacking for good and right reasons. Ethical hacking so they basically act ethically. But this is just a marketing term. Tapi ini ambigu, spying isn’t ethical marketing concept. Only do hacking for the good such as looking for vulnerabilities
    Grey hat hackers : can be good  or bad, they understand how the system works so well and sometimes modify the system to improve. They may be saint or evil, so the position of the grey hat hackers is in the middle between black hat hackers and white hat hackers.

Also, there are three level of hacking skills.

    Computer science skill level. They are impressive people who learn about networking protocol, people who actually program, create viruses, malware, and fixes bugs. They are those who have high level of hacking skill, who understands, develops, and modify system or program.
    Technician class hacker, people who modify other people program, new and better tool to use in the open source market.
    The script kiddies, they are non technical people and decide to use other program, download virus and share it to others. All they do is install software into the computer and capture all the files and informations such as spying kids. They are just consumer people who use program on the market, they don’t understand what are computers are and how the computer system works.

Why hacker hacks?

    To acquire data for good or bad intentions. Good? For data recovery, pictures programs, and security testing. Bad? To acquire someone’s password, contact information, credit card, and monitor users activity for bad things.
    To impersonate somebody, stealing somebody identity and use it to deceive people.
    Destruction, destroy somebody you don’t like to shut them down
    Just for FUN. 

Hackers have 2 methods plan of attack, Physical and Digital Methods.

    Physical
        Hackers will pretend as a computer technician
        He will get into the building and gain access from the usb he / she attach to the server, and start hacking
    Digital

    Flood the target with so much data, that create the data full, and they can’t get out the data inside
    Backdoors, gaining unauthorized access to the system, and get in the computer.
    “Click this link here” or using advertisement. It’s a virus when it’s clicked, hacker can gain data from someone who click it.


To protect hacker himself, usually hacker will go to open cafe outside his town, and use the open wireless. This will prevent him to be tracked. He will go as far as possible and use internet connection which not even connected to him. He will make sure no trace of activities, temporary files and log files will be deleted, use somebody else’s computer, library computer, cafe computer, or buy a single use device(disposable). Because all of your activities on internet could be and usually tracked, through the firewall, computer systems, logging information all can be tracked. So to protect yourself from the hackers, use cash instead of credit card because they can get your credit card information and use it for their purpose. Other thing to protect ourselves is to  understand what hacker do, and it will be easy to guard ourselves against them.

In this video, I learn so many things that I didn’t know before. I like how Eli explained to us, from the contents until the examples of each cases. He talks clearly and well prepared, so we can easily understand what he tries to say. The content of this video is interesting, that’s why we choose this video to be reviewed.
